### Exercise 3: Reading and Parsing CSV Data

**Time Estimate:** 50 minutes

**Description:** Create a Java program that reads and parses CSV data from a file using `FileChannel`, `ByteBuffer`, and regular expressions. You'll extract and print specific information from the CSV file.

**Guidelines:**

1. Read the contents of a CSV file (e.g., "data.csv") into a `ByteBuffer`.

2. Parse the CSV data using regular expressions to extract specific information (e.g., names and ages of individuals).

3. Print the extracted data to the console.
